PaintballBooth
==============

A paintball themed exercise in building an MVC framework.

Practice building a bootstrap, routing requests to a proper controller, asking models for data to render views, and building the
model layer as data mappers that interact with the database and map query results to data objects.  The project also has a Controller_Ajax PHP class that manages data exchange with certain frontend areas in javascript/jquery.  Javascript is written in an attempt to follow the contstructor pattern.

Site is not currently live, but the codebase should be decently easy to understand. Features are you can create profiles, edit your information, and use the terrible messaging system that was the latest "project" to implement.  This was one of my first attempts to understand MVC, and while it unlocked a lot of understanding of those design patterns, this project is not a good example of many techniques.  It needs hugely improved encapsulation, classes hardly take advantage of inheritance, and privacy is not properly utilized if at all except in the router class.

Thanks for looking!
