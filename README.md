PaintballBooth
==============

A paintball themed exercise in building an MVC framework and using it for a web application.

Practice building a bootstrap, routing requests to a proper controller, asking models for data to render views, and building the
model layer as data mappers that interact with the database and map query results to data objects.  The project also has a Controller_Ajax PHP class that manages data exchange with certain frontend areas in javascript/jquery classes.

Site is not currently live, but the codebase should be decently easy to understand. Features are you can create profiles, edit your information, and use the terrible messaging system that was the latest "project" to implement.

Thanks for looking!
