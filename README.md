PaintballBooth
==============

A paintball themed exercise in building an MVC framework

Practice building a bootstrap, routing requests to a proper control, rendering views, and building the
model layer as a combination of data mappers that interact with the database and map query results to data objects.

Site is live at paintballbooth.com, where you can create profiles, edit your information, and use the (so-far)
terrible messaging system that is my current "project" to implement.

Thanks for looking!
