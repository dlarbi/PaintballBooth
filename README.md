PaintballBooth
==============

A paintball themed exercise in building an MVC framework

Practice building a bootstrap, routing requests to a proper controller, rendering views, and building the
model layer as data mappers that interact with the database and map query results to data objects.

Site is not currently live, but the codebase should be decently easy to understand :). Features are you can create profiles, edit your information, and use the (so-far) terrible messaging system that is my current "project" to implement.

Thanks for looking!
